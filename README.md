**Welcome to the Decentralized Land Registry project, an open-source venture that aims to redefine land transactions with the power of blockchain. Leveraging advanced blockchain technology, this project introduces an innovative way to manage and conduct land transactions transparently, securely, and efficiently.**

## Introduction

The traditional land registry systems are often fraught with inefficiencies, potential for fraud, and lack of transparency. Our solution, a blockchain-based land registry, addresses these issues head-on by providing an immutable and public record of land transactions, drastically reducing the potential for fraud and manipulation. By combining cryptography and consensus algorithms, blockchain technology ensures that once data is added to the blockchain, it is virtually impossible to change.

This is an example of  a smart contract for a land registry system where an owner can register their land, update the land details, and even transfer ownership in a secure way. This contract makes land transactions more transparent and trustworthy.

The primary functionalities include:

1. Registration: When a user first registers a parcel of land, they are recorded as the owner of that parcel in the global state of the smart contract.

2. Land Update: The owner can update the details of their registered land. Any updates are recorded in the global state, ensuring that a history of changes is kept.

3. Ownership Transfer: If the owner decides to transfer their land, the contract allows for a seamless and secure transfer of ownership.

This Decentralized Land Registry project is set to revolutionize how we view land transactions, bringing about a new level of transparency and security. We're excited to embark on this journey towards a more efficient, reliable, and secure system for land transactions, and we warmly invite you to explore, contribute, and grow with us in this endeavor.

## Quick Start

...

## Contract

This PyTeal code defines a basic smart contract for a land registry. The contract allows an "owner" (the account that created the contract) to update a "land" global variable. Any other account that tries to call the contract will have their transaction rejected.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not cover all potential security vulnerabilities or complex needs of a real-world land registry system. The contract code should be audited by a professional before being used in a production environment.

- This ccontract has a `transfer_ownership` function that allows the owner to transfer ownership of the land to a new owner.
- The owner can call the contract with the first argument as `update_land`, followed by the new land details as the second argument, and the landID as the third argument to update land information.
- The owner can also call the contract with the first argument as `transfer_ownership`, followed by the new owner's address as the second argument to transfer the ownership.
- Non-owner transactions are still rejected.
