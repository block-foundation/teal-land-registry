# teal-land-registry






Please note that this is a simple, pseudocode version of a TEAL smart contract that might be used for a land registry. Algorand's TEAL doesn't natively support complex data structures or string manipulation, so building a land registry on Algorand would require more complex off-chain logic and a different on-chain design than Ethereum.

The example here only demonstrates an owner being able to update the "land" global variable. In a production environment, the specific requirements of the contract and the limitations of the TEAL language need to be taken into consideration, and the contract code should be audited by a professional.

Also, Algorand suggests using PyTeal, a Python language binding for TEAL that makes writing smart contracts easier and more secure. The PyTeal code gets compiled to TEAL code.

This PyTeal code defines a basic smart contract for a land registry. The contract allows an "owner" (the account that created the contract) to update a "land" global variable. Any other account that tries to call the contract will have their transaction rejected.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not cover all potential security vulnerabilities or complex needs of a real-world land registry system. The contract code should be audited by a professional before being used in a production environment.

This code works similarly to the previous example, but adds a new transfer_ownership function that allows the owner to transfer ownership of the land to a new owner.

The owner can call the contract with the first argument as "update_land", followed by the new land details as the second argument, and the landID as the third argument to update land information.

The owner can also call the contract with the first argument as "transfer_ownership", followed by the new owner's address as the second argument to transfer the ownership.

Non-owner transactions are still rejected.

Please note that this code should be audited by a professional before being used in a production environment as it is a simplified example and may not cover all potential security vulnerabilities.
